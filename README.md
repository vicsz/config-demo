## Demo Steps

### 1. Deploy to PCF

Build the application:

```sh
./mvn package
```

Deploy to PCF using the CLI:

```sh
cf push
```

> Use --no-route in case of conflicting routes.

### 2. Create and Bind the Config Service

This is required for Config Server Usage.

#### Ensure *Configuration Server* service is available in the CF MarketPlace

```sh
cf marketplace
```

Contact your PCF Cloud Ops team if it is not.

#### Create the Service

You can use a *plan* and *name* of your choice.

```sh
cf create-service metrics-forwarder unlimited myforwarder
```

#### Bind the Service to your Application

```sh
cf bind-service metrics-demo myforwarder
```

#### Restage your Application

```sh
cf restage metrics-demo
```
